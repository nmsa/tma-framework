# TMA-Deployment
In this directory are presented the following files that deploys some components of TMA framework:

 - `tma_deployment.yaml` - This file deploys Monitor, FaultTolerantQueue, and MySQL with `Ceph` block-storage;
 - `tma_deployment_without_ceph.yaml` - This file deploys  Monitor, FaultTolerantQueue, and `MySQL` without `Ceph` storage.

## Prerequisites

The instructions were tested in `ubuntu`, but should work in other `debian`-based distributions, assuming that you are able to install the key dependencies.

The first step is to install the required components: `Docker`, and `Kubernetes`.

To install `Docker`, you should execute the following command:

```sh
sudo su -
apt-get install docker.io
```
To install `Kubernetes` you should execute the following commands:

```sh
sudo su -
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add 
echo -e "deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main " >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
apt-get update
apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl kubernetes-cni
```

In order to use `Kubernetes` two machines (nodes) are required with different IP addresses for deploying all necessary pods.

These two nodes communicate through network plugin `Flannel`.

To initialize the `Kubernetes` cluster, run the following command in the Master machine:

```sh
swapoff -a
kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```

The output of the command above gives the required commands to complete the setup of `Kubernetes` cluster. Those commands are:

```sh
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

Before joining the other node in this cluster, it is necessary to setup the network plugin that is responsible for the communications between Master and Worker nodes.

To do that, run:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/k8s-manifests/kube-flannel-rbac.yml
ip route add 10.96.0.0/16 dev xxxxxx
```

Where xxxxxx is the network interface name.

After these commands, Master node will be at "Ready" state. For joining the other node, paste the last command of the output of the kubeadm init command in that node. One example of this command can be:

```sh
kubeadm join --token TOKEN MASTER_IP:6443
```

Where TOKEN is the token you were presented after initializing the master and MASTER_IP is the IP address of the master.

Now, the `Kubernetes` cluster is ready to deploy containers.

## Installation

After completing all steps of the previous section, it is necessary to initialize the kube-proxy service used by TMA_Analyze. To do that, you should execute the following command:

```sh
kubectl proxy --address IP_MASTER_MACHINE --port=8089 --accept-hosts '.*' &
```

After that, you need to build the base `Docker` image of TMA_Monitor using [`build.sh`](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework-m/blob/master/development/dependency/python-base/build.sh) script. To do that, you should run the following commnads in Worker node:

```sh
cd tma-framework-m/development/dependency/python-base/
sh build.sh
```

Also in Worker node, you need to run the script called [`setup-environment.sh`](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework-m/blob/new/master/development/server/monitor-server-python/monitor-api-python/setup-environment.sh) to generate the digital certificate according to the IP of the `Kubernetes` Master of your setup and build the monitor `Docker` image. This script receives as argument the IP of the Master Machine of your `Kubernetes` cluster.
 
To do that, you need to execute the following commands:

```sh
cd tma-framework-m/development/server/monitor-server-python/monitor-api-python
sh setup-environment.sh MASTER_IP
```

To deploy the `tma_deployment.yaml` file, first, you need to execute the commands presented in this [README](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework-k/tree/master/development/ceph).

With `Ceph` correctly configured, you need to execute the following commands in `Ceph` machine:

```sh
ceph auth get-key client.admin
echo [Output of the previous command]| base64
```

After that you need to replace in line 398 of yaml file the key with the one returned by the previous command. Finally, you need to replace the line 454 of the yaml file with the IP or FQDN of `Ceph` machine. To deploy TMA platform with `Ceph`, you just need to execute the following command:

```sh
kubectl create -f tma_deployment.yaml
```

To deploy `tma_deployment_without_ceph.yaml`, you just need to execute the following command:

```sh
kubectl create -f tma_deployment_without_ceph.yaml
```

After 5 minutes, all pods must be in "Running" state. This time depends on your internet connection.
